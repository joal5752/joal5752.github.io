Hi there! Thanks for checking out my website! I like to think of this site as my little outlet to talk about myself and document my experiences and thoughts! 

To continue on from what was said on the front page, I come from California. Sunny San Diego! America's Finest City! I lived there all my life leading up to my departure off to college.  

Some of my hobbies include: playing video games, making YouTube videos, and weightlifting (specifically powerlifting).  I play almost all kinds of video games, but my "specialty" is definitely FPS.  If you want to take a look at my YouTube videos, [click here][1]! I can talk a lot about lifting, so I think I will leave that to my next blog post!

Since I really have no idea how to blog, and since my intention was just to get a first blog post up I think I will end this entry here.  In the future I will try to either blog about my "Day In The Life" or simply about a topic I feel like talking about!

Thanks for taking the time to read this post! See you in the next one!
