# Hey again stranger! 
Welcome to my second blog post! I hope you've enjoyed looking around so far!

So like I mentioned in my ["About Me"][1] post, I am huge into fitness and powerlifting.  I want to go more into detail on that aspect of my life in another post because I simply have so much to say about it!

So what's the deal with the title of this post??? A couple weeks ago, I had posted a video of one of my lifting PRs (and if you wanna see any of my posts be sure to follow my [Instagram][2]).  After I posted this video, I was contacted through a Twitter DM that some company was wondering if I'd be interested in getting sponsored!  

# Who is Paragon Fitwear?
Paragon Fitwear is a fitness clothing companay.  Their products are of high quality and are a mixture of cotton and spandex, giving the clothes a light, airy, and strechy feel.  Also, the clothes are an athletic fit/cut meaning that they extend a few inches longer on the torso.  This helps when working out so that your shirt doesn't ride up and expose your rock hard abs /kappa...haha!!! Another nice thing about the shirts are that they are tapered so that the torso hugs the lats and tapers down near the waist to add to the illusion of being slim.  I recently picked up a stringer as well and those fit nicely, similar to the shirts just without sleeves essentially.  I hope to try the joggers soon, once I get a hold of them I'll review them, too!

### "Hey Jack! Where can I get some clothes?"
Well I'm glad you asked!!! [Click Here][3] to check out Paragon's website!!! Take a look around and see if you can find something you like!  If you have any questions feel free to contact them or shoot me a tweet [@torchyhd][4]!!! I respond to both tweets and DM's! And if you are truly interested in purchasing some apparel I can help with that! Use promo code "JACKAL" at checkout for 10% off any item on the site!!!

Thanks again for checking out my blog! I hope you enjoyed this post and I will see you in the next one!
